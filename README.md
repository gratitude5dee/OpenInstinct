## Why self-host?

Personal agents are much more useful when they can sign in, book, buy and act
on your behalf. But your accounts, your passwords, are the keys to your digital
kingdom. OpenInstinct runs in your own Vercel account. Secrets are encrypted
before they touch your database and models never see them. Verify yourself by
reading the code!

## Deployment

The deploy button provisions [Kernel](https://kernel.sh) for cloud browsers,
[Neon](https://neon.tech) for Postgres, and a private Vercel Blob store for
browser images. Vercel AI Gateway handles inference.
[Linq](https://linq.app) is optional and requires the setup below before
iMessage or production phone sign-in is available. Usage is billed to your
Vercel account. Before clicking the button, generate two values:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32 # BETTER_AUTH_SECRET
openssl rand -base64 32 # SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY
```

The Vercel flow asks for both values before the first deployment. It derives
`BETTER_AUTH_URL` from the deployment and receives the database and Kernel
credentials from the provisioned products, so no post-deploy configuration or
Stripe API key is required for the app build or Link Wallet itself. Production
phone sign-in and iMessage still require the optional Linq setup below.

The application database schema and versioned migrations live in `db/`. The
Drizzle application store uses `DATABASE_URL` for runtime queries; its migration
commands require the direct `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` connection. Run
`pnpm db:migrate` before starting against a new or upgraded local database.
Vercel uses Turbo to run the uncached migration task before its application
build. See [`db/README.md`](db/README.md) for existing-database adoption,
environment loading, and constraint-validation sequencing. Better Auth retains
its separate migration path.

Treat `SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` as production key material — back it up
separately; rotating it requires re-encrypting existing values.

### Browser image storage

The one-click deploy creates and connects a private Blob store automatically.
Vercel supplies `BLOB_STORE_ID` and a short-lived `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN` to each
deployment, so there is no long-lived Blob credential to copy.

For an existing Vercel project, link it first with
`eve link --project <your-vercel-project> --non-interactive`, then create and
connect the store with one command:

```bash
pnpm exec vercel blob create-store open-instinct-images --access private --yes --environment production --environment preview --environment development
```

Outside Vercel, set `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` from a private Blob store instead.
Browser image storage is optional at build time; without either configuration,
the rest of OpenInstinct runs normally and image capture returns an actionable
setup error.

### Linq iMessage setup

Link the checkout to your Vercel project, create a Linq line, and attach its
connector for both app tokens and inbound webhook triggers:

```bash
vercel link
vercel connect create linq --connection-method line --name open-instinct --json
vercel connect attach <returned-connector-uid> --project <your-vercel-project> --environment production --triggers --trigger-path /eve/v1/linq --yes
vercel env add LINQ_CONNECTOR production --value <returned-connector-uid> --yes
vercel env add LINQ_PHONE_NUMBER production --value <assigned-e164-number> --yes
vercel deploy --prod
```

The create command returns the connector UID. Run
`vercel connect open <returned-connector-uid>`, copy the assigned line from the
connector dashboard in E.164 format, and use it for `LINQ_PHONE_NUMBER`. Both
`LINQ_CONNECTOR` and `LINQ_PHONE_NUMBER` must be configured together. Repeat the
attachment and environment-variable steps for preview or development if those
environments should use Linq too.

Before signing in, use that connector dashboard to add each user's phone number
under **Messaging Contacts**. Linq rejects OTP delivery and drops inbound texts
from contacts that are not on this allowlist. The
`--triggers --trigger-path /eve/v1/linq` options are also required: attaching a
connector without them permits outbound token access but does not forward
incoming messages to OpenInstinct.

## Google Workspace connection

OpenInstinct can use a user's Gmail, Calendar, and read-only Contacts through a
user-scoped Google OAuth grant. Vercel Connect stores and refreshes the tokens;
OpenInstinct stores only the stable user identity used to request them. Gmail
access deliberately uses `gmail.modify`, not the permanent-delete
`mail.google.com` scope.

1. In one Google Cloud project, configure the OAuth consent screen and enable
   the Gmail API, Google Calendar API, and People API.
2. Create OAuth web credentials. Add
   `https://connect.vercel.com/callback` as an authorized redirect URI, then
   download the client-secret JSON.
3. Vercel expects top-level `clientId` and `clientSecret` keys, not Google's
   nested `web.client_id` and `web.client_secret` download. Convert the download
   into a temporary file outside the repository, then create and attach the
   connector:

   ```bash
   vercel link
   google_credentials_file="$(mktemp)"
   jq '{clientId: .web.client_id, clientSecret: .web.client_secret}' /absolute/path/to/downloaded-client-secret.json > "$google_credentials_file"
   vercel connect create google --connection-method oauth --name open-instinct --data @"$google_credentials_file"
   rm -f "$google_credentials_file"
   vercel connect attach <returned-connector-uid> --project <your-vercel-project> --environment production --yes
   vercel env pull
   ```

   Never commit either credential file.

4. Set `GOOGLE_CONNECTOR_UID` to the returned UID and redeploy. The default is
   `google/open-instinct`.

Gotchas:

- Attach the connector separately to every Vercel environment that should use
  it. A production attachment does not make preview or local development work.
- The Gmail read/modify scope is restricted. A Google OAuth app in Testing mode
  only works for listed test users, and those grants expire after seven days.
  Broader distribution requires Google's OAuth verification and may require a
  security assessment.
- The scopes requested here must also be declared on the Google consent screen.
  After changing scopes or enabled APIs, disconnect and reconnect the account so
  Google issues a grant with the new access.
- The grant is keyed to the authenticated OpenInstinct user. iMessage reaches
  the same grant only when its verified phone number maps to that Better Auth
  account.
- Google Contacts search uses a provider-side lazy cache, so a contact created
  moments ago may not appear immediately.
- Sending email and creating confirmed calendar events always require approval.
  Calendar events with attendees send Google invitations.

## Stripe Link Agent Wallet

OpenInstinct can use [Link Agent Wallet](https://link.com/agents) for buyer-side
purchase approval and one-time payment credentials. This is different from
adding Stripe Elements to a merchant site: OpenInstinct connects the user's
Link wallet, prepares a third-party checkout, sends the exact merchant, items,
and total to Link for approval, then resumes the same browser automatically.

No Stripe API key or additional Vercel integration is required. After deploying:

1. Open the workspace and choose **Connect** beside **Link Wallet**.
2. Open the displayed Link verification URL and approve the short phrase.
3. Ask OpenInstinct to prepare a purchase. On supported Stripe checkouts it uses
   a merchant-bound Link Pay Token; on ordinary card forms it uses a one-time
   virtual card. Link profile and default shipping details are securely
   autofilled without entering model context.

Link approval replaces the duplicate price confirmation in chat. A higher
total or material order change always requires a new approval, and a denied or
expired Link request never silently falls back to a saved card. If Link is not
connected or is unavailable, OpenInstinct preserves the existing encrypted
vault checkout flow.

Link Agent Wallet is currently available to US Link accounts. Review Stripe's
[agentic commerce documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/agentic-commerce) and
the [official Link CLI](https://github.com/stripe/link-cli) before a public
production launch.

## Local development

Docker Desktop (or another Docker Compose installation) is required. Configure
the non-database variables in `.env.example`, then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gratitude5dee/OpenInstinct.git
cd open-instinct
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

`pnpm dev` starts PostgreSQL from `compose.yaml`, applies the committed database
migrations, and starts the application. Stopping the development process also
stops and removes the PostgreSQL container; its data remains in the
`postgres-data` volume for the next run. Run `pnpm dev:app` when intentionally
using an externally managed database instead.

Local development otherwise uses the same vault, Kernel browser, and AI Gateway
path as the Vercel deployment. Better Auth and vault encryption use stable
local-only defaults when their variables are unset; deployments still require
explicit secrets.
